This package is designed to take away some grunt work around setting up new projects.

All projects get setup with Git and Travis by default.

- Use `createPackageProject` to setup a project with code coverage, vignettes, unit testing etc out of the box
- Use `createAnalysisProject` to get a project ready for a typical analysis project. It includes packrat to help with reproducibility.
- Use `createTrainingProject` to get a project ready for delivering training that often involves handouts and presentation materials. It includes packrat to help with reproducibility.
