This package is designed to take away some grunt work around setting up new projects.

All projects get setup with Git and Travis by default.

- Use `createPackageProject` to setup a project with code coverage, vignettes, unit testing etc out of the box
- Use `createAnalysisProject` to get a project ready for a typical analysis project. It includes packrat to help with reproducibility.
- Use `createTrainingProject` to get a project ready for delivering training that often involves handouts and presentation materials. It includes packrat to help with reproducibility.

## Install `pRojects`

```
devtools::install_github("stephlocke/pRojects")
```

## RStudio gadget
If you want to set up a pRoject without using the R functions, [\@jonmcalder](https://github.com/jonmcalder) made a nifty [RStudio addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) for making pRojects. Install the package to get it added to your RStudio instance.
